# Performance-Report
The goal of this project was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze quantity performance and gross profitability across multiple countries and months. 
The dashboard allows users to explore trends, identify increases and decreases in sales, and segment accounts by profitability. 

The data was pre-processed and cleaned using **Power Query**, including merging multiple sources, filtering, and transforming columns to ensure consistency. 
The dashboard also leverages **advanced DAX measures** to perform dynamic calculations, such as Year-To-Date comparisons, as well as fully dynamic measures that change based on slicer selections, allowing users to switch between metrics interactively.
